I am an Assistant Professor at the Graduate School of Science and Technology Policy ([STP](https://stp.kaist.ac.kr/FacultyFull_time_Professor/view/id/90)) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ([KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/)). My work sits at the intersection of the sociology of science, the sociology of work, and public policy. I study topics such as the division of labor in research teams, mentoring and training strategies, scientific careers and inequality, research misconduct and accountability, and the evolving role of AI in scientific production. Methodologically, I combine large-scale bibliometric and administrative data with computational text and network analysis, as well as ethnographic fieldwork to capture the organizational and social processes underlying scientific production.

Prior to joining KAIST, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Science of Science and Innovation (CSSI) at the Kellogg School of Management. I received my Ph.D. in Public Policy from the Georgia Institute of Technology, an M.S. in Statistics from Georgia Tech’s School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and a B.A. in Economics from the University of Colorado Boulder. Beyond contemporary science policy, I am also interested in the long-run cultural evolution of science and invention, using large-scale digitized historical archives and computational methods to study how knowledge systems change over time.
